## Tasks for Claude Code

### Augmented research with product focus (VP, AAA, platform, network effects)
1. Research thoroughly and distill the value propositions and UNIQUE SELLING POINTS of our solution
   - Scrutinize and critique the vision/intent of this solution, with the focus of creating a product with perfect product market fit
   - Research widely on competing products, gaps, painpoints, and any other information that can help us build a solid base of value propositions
   - It is critical to define the unique selling points. Do not confuse value proposition with unique selling points.
     - Be extremely critical and scrutinize your unique selling points.
2. Evaluate it using platform model thinking
   - Seamless direct transactions between users (producers, consumers, partners)
     - Producers: Users who offer/deliver a product or service
     - Consumers: Users who consume a product or service
     - Partners: To facilitate the transaction between producers and consumers
3. Evaluate it using the AAA framework
   - Automate: Reduce operational costs
   - Augment: Reduce decision-making costs
   - Amplify: Reduce expertise costs (for scaling)
4. Features must sufficiently cover the following network behaviors to achieve strong network effects
   - Accessibility: Easy for users to complete a transaction
     - transaction is activity between producer and consumer, not necessarily monetary in nature)
   - Engagement: Information that are useful to users for completing a transaction
   - Personalization: Information that are curated for an intended use
   - Connection: Information sources that are connected to the platform (one or two-way)
   - Collaboration: Producers and consumers can jointly work together seamlessly
5. Document in details, your analysis in docs/01-analysis, and plans in docs/02-plans, and user flows in docs/03-user-flows.
   - Use as many subdirectories and files as required
   - Name them sequentially as 01-, 02-, etc, for easy referencing
